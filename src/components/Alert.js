Alright so here we start with our topic which is guided by Silviya maam and been worked on by the team, which is
Hospital Management System COVID-19 and Outbreak Prediction using ML, whoch has one basic motive which 
is to improve efficiency and simplicity of management in such difficult times of pandemic. 
This site will eradicate use of several web/apps for functioning and put it all in one! 
Thus making a single platform integrated with COVID Outbreak Prediction System. 
Especially for people worried about tomorrow!
So that was a brief introduction of the topic now, 

I'll start with Problem Statement
Hospital Management System is basically system that takes down info on 
hospitals and their patients. It also provides various basic functions for hospital 
staff to make management easier. Our main motive is to make a bridge between hospitals and common public.

Now moving towards objectives behind this:
1. administer patientâ€™s information and admission 
for which we'll have functions like symtoms tracker and patients records
2. admission bills
where we'll note down expenses and print the invoice or the bills
3. Appointments
The name says it, appointments will be noted down here
4. Monitors inventory
Noting of tools, devices, amenities etc will be carried out here

Next would be Literature Survey which would be done by Suraj Tambe, over to you Suraj!
